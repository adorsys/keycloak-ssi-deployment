# OID4VCI Conformance Test - Send Credential Offer Script (Interactive)
# This script sends the credential offer to the OpenID Foundation conformance test suite
# Runs one command at a time for better debugging and control
#
# Expected behavior:
# - The test suite will receive the credential offer successfully
# - It may return a 400 error about missing authorization_details in token response
# - This is expected and helps identify configuration issues in Keycloak
